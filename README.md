# Projected-Gradient-Descent-with-CIFAR10
Implementation of PGD attack on a model trained on cifar10 dataset in tensorflow. Also, FID between original images and generated images has been calculated.
The FID implementation inspired from a post on machinelearningmastery.com link- https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-implement-the-frechet-inception-distance-fid-from-scratch/
Link to research paper on PGD attack - Towards Deep Learning Models Resistant to Adversarial (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.06083.pdf)
